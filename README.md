# DBMS-Project
The source code is for DBMS project "Library Management System" which is build using Java and MySQL database which was done in third year.
This project is based on Library Management System in which students can issue books, admin can create accounts of librarian who can then 
use this system for issuing books to students. This project internally uses JAVA for frontend development and MySQl and JDBC for backend 
and database connectivity. I have also attached screenshot of the software which shows how it works at runtime which can be seen using 
Screenshot file.The project was implemented using java swing package,MySQL jar and Eclipse IDE.
